🎙️ Gemini Voice Assistant
A simple web application that uses Google Gemini 1.5 Flash to power a voice-activated assistant. This project allows users to record their voice, which is then transcribed and answered by the Gemini API, providing a seamless and interactive experience.

✅ What I Did in This Project
✔️ Developed a Flask backend to handle audio processing and API communication.
✔️ Built a clean, responsive frontend using HTML and Tailwind CSS.
✔️ Integrated the Google Gemini API to transcribe and respond to voice queries.
✔️ Implemented a robust audio recording and playback system using the browser's MediaRecorder API.
✔️ Designed a clear and intuitive user interface with a simple record/stop button.
✔️ Ensured proper cleanup by deleting temporary audio files from both the local server and Gemini's file service after use.
✔️ Incorporated error handling for common issues like microphone access failures or API errors.
